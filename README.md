# Set Up and Folder Structure

All of the experiments can be run using the run.bat batch script.

The run.bat creates a new directory for each experiment named experiment 1, 2, and 3, this directory contains three subdirectories:

- **inputs** - contains the input data and input parameters for the experiment
- **outputs** - contains the output files from the experiment from each scheduler
- **schedulers** - contains the simulator_parameters files from the experiment from each scheduler

If you'd like to run the Python scripts provided below, please ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, these scripts rely on external libraries, namely pandas and matplotlib. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer, by executing the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

**Terminial commands:**

- `pip install pandas`

- `pip install matplotlib`
