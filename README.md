# Operating Systems Coursework
This repositorie contains my Operating Systems module coursework which I took as part of my Computer Science Degree during my second year at The Univeristy of Sussex.

The assignment was to construct various CPU scheduling algorithms and then devise a set of tests to evaluate and contrast the various methods' performances. 

My score was 85 out of 100.

# Set Up and Folder Structure

All of the experiments can be run using the run.bat batch script.

The run.bat creates a new directory for each experiment named experiment 1, 2, and 3, this directory contains three subdirectories:

- **inputs** - contains the input data and input parameters for the experiment
- **outputs** - contains the output files from the experiment from each scheduler
- **schedulers** - contains the simulator_parameters files from the experiment from each scheduler

If you'd like to run the Python scripts provided below, please ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, these scripts rely on external libraries, namely pandas and matplotlib. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer, by executing the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

**Terminial commands:**

- `pip install pandas`

- `pip install matplotlib`
